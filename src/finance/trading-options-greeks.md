## The Basics of Options Greeks

### The Basics

An option is a contract that gives its owner the right to buy or the right to sell a fixed quantity of an underlying security at a specific price within a certain time constraint, where a call corresponds to the right to buy and a put corresponds to the right to sell.

- The option buyer is the party who owns the right inherent in the contract. At expiration, the owner may exercise the right or let it expire without exercising it. Option holders won't receive dividends or have voting rights.
- The option seller is the party who owns the obligation inherent in the contract. When a trader who is long an option exercises, a trader with a short position gets assigned. Assignment means the trader with the short option position is called on to fulfill the obligation.

Exchange-listed options contracts are standardized, such that each

Volume is the total number of contracts traded during a time period, which can be stated on a one-day basis. Open interest is the number of contracts that have been created and remain outstanding, which is a running total.

The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) guarantees all options trades. When a trader buys an option through a broker, the broker submits the trade information to its clearing firm. The clearing firms on both sides submit the trade information to the OCC, which matches up the trade. When the buyer exercises the option, the OCC assigns one of its clearing members with a customer that shorts the option, and the clearing member will assign the trade either randomly or first in, first out.
